        We're no strangers to love <br>
        You know the rules and so do I (do I) <br>
        A full commitment's what I'm thinking of <br>
        You wouldn't get this from any other guy <br>
        I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling <br>
        Gotta make you understand <br>
        Never gonna give you up <br>
        Never gonna let you down <br>
        Never gonna run around and desert you <br>
        Never gonna make you cry <br>
        Never gonna say goodbye <br>
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you <br>
        We've known each other for so long <br>
        Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it) <br>
        Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on) <br>
        We know the game and we're gonna play it <br>
        And if you ask me how I'm feeling <br>
        Don't tell me you're too blind to see <br>
        Never gonna give you up <br>
        Never gonna let you down <br>
        Never gonna run around and desert you <br>
        Never gonna make you cry <br>
        Never gonna say goodbye <br>
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you <br>
        Never gonna give you up <br>
        Never gonna let you down <br>
        Never gonna run around and desert you <br>
        Never gonna make you cry <br>
        Never gonna say goodbye <br>
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you <br>
